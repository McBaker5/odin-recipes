    </p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons grits</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 cup diced tasso ham</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons diced onion</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons diced green bell pepper</li>
        <li>20 medium shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
        <li>1/4 cup white wine</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped green onion, green parts only</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Bring water and 1 pinch of salt to a boil in a saucepan and slowly mix in the grits, stirring constantly. Reduce heat to low and simmer grits until tender and smooth, about 20 minutes; stir often. Set aside and keep warm.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir tasso ham until crisp. Stir in onion and green bell pepper and cook until onion is translucent, about 4 minutes. Lightly stir the shrimp with the vegetables and olive oil just until pink, 30 to 45 seconds; remove shrimp from pan and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour white wine into the skillet and stir, dissolving any browned bits of food in the bottom of the skillet; slowly add the cream, reduce heat to low, and simmer until thickened, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
            Divide the grits onto 2 serving plates and line the edge of each plate with 10 shrimp. Pour cream sauce over grits and sprinkle each serving with chopped green onion tops.
        </li>
    </ol>
