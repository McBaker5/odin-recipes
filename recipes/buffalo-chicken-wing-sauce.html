    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        If you know someone from Buffalo, they know someone who told them the secret ingredients to the Anchor Bar's famous Buffalo chicken wings. I know people from Buffalo. This is my version, as described to me many years ago, over almost as many beers.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2/3 cup hot pepper sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 cup cold unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons white vinegar</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>

        <li>
            Combine the hot sauce, butter, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, and salt in a pot and place over medium heat. Bring to a simmer while stirring with a whisk. As soon as the liquid begins to bubble on the sides of the pot, remove from heat, stir with the whisk, and set aside for use.
