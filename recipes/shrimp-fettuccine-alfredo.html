    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        This is a very simple recipe and it tastes divine! My sister and I were trying to come up with the perfect Alfredo recipe and we found it.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound fettuccini pasta</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>1 pound cooked shrimp - peeled</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 cup half-and-half</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons grated parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a large skillet, cook and stir shrimp and garlic in the butter for about one minute. Pour in half and half; stir. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese in one tablespoon at a time, stirring constantly. After all Parmesan is added, mix in parsley and salt. Stir frequently making sure it does not boil. Sauce will take a while to thicken.
        </li>
        <li>
            When sauce has thickened, combine with cooked pasta noodles; serve hot.
        </li>
    </ol>
